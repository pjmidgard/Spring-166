Algorithm Sha-256_Jurijus_Pacalovas:

Spring-166_Jurijus_Pacalovas Algorithm: divide by 8 and move 4 bias of bits information where is compress saved 2**64 for 4 GB it enough if divide 1 if not zero. In the start and on the end divide 2**24-1 but not change numbers and save 2**24 or 2**32 32bits dipense size of file. Save it. Save of long information size of file, save times of compress 1-2**24 save it while we get 2**256 bits. For extract we need find information+ what divide plus while we extract we check information compress. 496bits-+ Divide side right save save it in left, left side bias data save in right. In the finish add in the left add 1 after zero in the left after this 1 like 1, 01, 001, 0001, 00001, 000001, 0000001, 00000001, 000000001. On the end: Count how many times, size of file and number of divded 2**24 or 2**32. Everything save. Save every time size of file how we control size of file and count times of compress: add 1 binary minus 2  or add 0 binary +1 bits, minus -3 or the same size add one or zero.
