Algorithm Sha-256_Jurijus_Pacalovas:

Spring-166_Jurijus_Pacalovas Algorithm: divide by 8 and move 4 bias of bits information where is compress saved 2**64 for 4 GB it enough if divide 1 if not zero. In the start and on the end divide 2**24-1 but not change numbers and save 2**24 or 2**32 32bits dipense size of file. Save it. Save of long information size of file, save times of compress 1-2**24 save it while we get 2**256 bits. For extract we need find information+ what divide plus while we extract we check information compress. 496bits-+ and minus 2  or +1 bits.

Bias, Divide move and Reverse.
