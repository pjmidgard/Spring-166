Algorithm Sha-256:

Spring-166 Algorithm: divide by seven and move bias of bits information where is compress saved 2**64 for 4 GB it enough if divide 1 if not zero. In the start and on the end divide 2**24-1 but not change numbers and save 2**8, 2**16, 2**24, 2**32 and 2**40 dipense size of file. Save it. Save of long information size of file, save times of compress 1-2**24 save it while we get 2**256 bits. For extract we need find information+ what divide plus while we extract we check information compress.

Bias, Divide move and Reverse.
